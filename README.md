# Pajamas

Source code contributed and owned by the Pajamas community for the website and other related content to promote the Pajamas token.

# Goals for the Website
1. Identify the target audience (people who would want to own meme coins but dont know anything about them)
2. Build the website to have step by step instructions on how to buy $pajamas
3. Show the adoption rates of $pajamas in the website to create FOMO. Live numbers of each purchase. 
4. UI has to be very good and easy to understand. 

# Messaging
1. Pajamas is a community project.  This is to the point that even the source code behind the website is on GitHub for anyone to see.
2. We will provide instructions to smoothly guide any participants, experienced or new, to the world of tokens into the project.
3. We will slowly but continuously expand the outreach of the token.

# Story
